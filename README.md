# igiari
Igiari is a work-in-progress engine for the Ace Attorney games released by Capcom. Currently, work is set on support the Trilogy Remaster that's released on Steam.

# Warning
This is not yet playable as of the time that I'm writing this. There's still a long way to go, but if you wanna add in some help then feel free to make a pull request or ask!

# Dependecies
- Raylib (5.0.0)
- LZ4

Everything else is coded in pure C.
